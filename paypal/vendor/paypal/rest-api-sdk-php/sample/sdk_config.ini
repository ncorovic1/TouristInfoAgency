;Logging Information
[Log]
; For custom logging implementation, you can set the
; logging factory provider class here.
; The class should be implementing \PayPal\Log\PayPalLogFactory.
; If this is not set, it will default to \PayPal\Log\PayPalDefaultLogFactory.
;log.AdapterFactory=\PayPal\Log\PayPalDefaultLogFactory

; Settings for PayPalDefaultLogFactory
log.LogEnabled=true

; When using a relative path, the log file is created
; relative to the .php file that is the entry point
; for this request. You can also provide an absolute
; path here
; Settings for PayPalDefaultLogFactory
log.FileName=../PayPal.log

; Logging level can be one of any provided at \Psr\Log\LogLevel
; Logging is most verbose in the 'DEBUG' level and
; decreases as you proceed towards ERROR
; DEBUG level is disabled for live, to not log sensitive information.
; If the level is set to DEBUG, it will be reduced to INFO automatically
log.LogLevel=INFO

;Caching Configuration
[cache]
; If Cache is enabled, it stores the access token retrieved from ClientId and Secret from the
; server into a file provided by the cache.FileName option or by using 
; the constant $CACHE_PATH value in PayPal/Cache/AuthorizationCache if the option is omitted/empty.
; If the value is set to 'true', it would try to create a file and store the information.
; For any other value, it would disable it
; Please note, this is a very good performance improvement, and we would encourage you to
; set this up properly to reduce the number of calls, to almost 50% on normal use cases
; PLEASE NOTE: You may need to provide proper write permissions to /var directory under PayPal-PHP-SDK on
; your hosting server or whichever custom directory you choose
cache.enabled=true
; When using a relative path, the cache file is created
; relative to the .php file that is the entry point
; for this request. You can also provide an absolute
; path here
cache.FileName=../auth.cache
